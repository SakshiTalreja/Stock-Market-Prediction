# Stock Market Prediction

Here in '9_8_21_Maruti_NS_Best_MLalgo.ipynb' we applied Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and KNN on stock market data. We conclude that Random Forest is best ML algorithm among these for predicting stock price based on the accuracy of the models.and in 31_07_2021_TCS_NS_Ensemble_Technique we predicted RSI for TCS dataset and using ensemble learning approach we predicted buy/sell.
